Middleware is a function which is called before the route handler.


Capabilities of middlewares:

1) execute any code.
2) make changes to the request and the response objects.
3) end the request-response cycle.
4) call the next middleware function in the stack.
5) if the current middleware function does not end the request-response cycle, 
   it must call next() to pass control to the next middleware function. 
   Otherwise, the request will be left hanging.
